# Mafkin_Robotics_DeepFeat

## Description
DeepFeat is a repository that aims to design, analyze and test existing as well as novel alogrithms for keypoint extraction and description using deep learning model. These experiments are a part of a larger underwater AUV project 
that aims to automate the process of ship hull cleaning. The keypoints are being extracted for Visual SLAM and depth map reconstruction.
